## üìå Introduction
Cardiotocography (CTG) is widely used to monitor fetal well-being. This project uses CTG-derived features to classify fetal health into three categories:  
- **Normal**  
- **Suspect**  
- **Pathological**

## üéØ Project Goal
To train, evaluate, and deploy machine learning models to predict fetal health, and identify the most accurate classifier for deployment in Azure.

## üß¨ Dataset Overview
- Source: [Kaggle - Fetal Health Classification](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/andrewmvd/fetal-health-classification)
- 2126 samples, 21 features + 1 target variable (`fetal_health`)
- Health classes:
  - `1`: Normal
  - `2`: Suspect
  - `3`: Pathological

---

## üßπ Data Preprocessing
- **Outliers removed** using Z-score > 3
- **StandardScaler** used for feature scaling
- No missing values
- `health_status` column added for interpretability
- Final dataset: 1719 rows

---

## üìä Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Histograms plotted for all features
- Correlation heatmap confirmed strong inter-feature relationships
- No features were dropped

## ‚öñÔ∏è Ethical & Social Considerations
- **Privacy & Security**: Data compliance (GDPR, HIPAA)
- **Fairness**: Avoiding bias in healthcare predictions
- **Transparency**: Use of explainable AI techniques
- **Accountability**: Shared responsibility in clinical use

---

## ‚úÖ Conclusion
- **CNN** and **XGBoost** delivered top performance
- **XGBoost (tuned)** was deployed using Azure ML
- Project shows promise for real-time fetal health prediction in clinical settings
